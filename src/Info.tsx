    Hi! I'm a programmer with a passion for problem-solving and realizing
    projects. I really believe that "No problem can withstand the assault of
    sustained thinking." I'm a bootcamp grad, but I consider myself mostly
    self-taught because of the considerable amount of time I spend learning on
    my own. I work hard, and I'm forever curious.
